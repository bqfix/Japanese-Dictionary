= Japanese Dictionary

### Description
This is a Japanese dictionary that utilizes locally stored assets to create a small subset of words for the user to peruse.
This project was built for the Udacity Android Developement for Beginners nanodegree.

### What I accomplished in this project:

* Created a miniature dictionary containing 40 Japanese words, their translations, and relevant pictures.
* Utilized AudioManager and MediaPlayer to pronounce the word on click.
* Implemented ViewPager and fragments to create easy and smooth access to different categories.
